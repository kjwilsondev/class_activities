# 18.10.25 Class Notes

## Random Dictionary Words Code Review:

Cheating
- .shuffle
- .counter
- .choice

### Nathan:
```python

import random
word_num = sys.argv[1]

def dict_sentence(word_num):
    with open("/usr/share/dict/words") as file:
        dict_word = file.read().splitlines()

    random_num_array = list() # line number Nathan wants to read

    for _ in range(int(word_num)):
        random_num_array.append(randint(0, len(dict_word)-1))

    for rand in random_num_array:
        print(''.join(dict_word[rand]), end=' ')

dict_sentence(word_num)
print("hello")
```

##### Nathan:
by default with open files open in read mode

##### Dylan:
used timeInt
- look into timeInt
You probably don't need two for loops to do this

##### Tim:
Could use Doc String explaining what it does at beginning of code

##### Vincenzo:
Scoping Rules
- look up scoping rules

##### ? :
No return value

### Jasmine:

```python
import random_num_arrayfrom sys import argv

def get_word(wordlist):
    '''
    returns a random word from wordlist
    '''
    return random.choice(wordlist)

def get_words(num, wordlist):
    '''
    returns num number of words from the wordlist
    '''
    words= list()
    for _ in range(num):
        word = get_word(wordlist)
        words.append(word)
    return words

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with open("/usr/shar/dict/words") as words:
        words = words.read().splitlines()

    my_words = get_words(int( argv[1]), words)
    print(" ".join(my_words))

```

##### Asim:
Appreciated Modularity

##### Nolan:
if name is helpful
- look more into if name

##### Alan:
- would like argv[1] to have a name
- make function for bottom four lines to keep logic outside of "if __name__"

## Histogram Implementations:

|                | Effort            | Speed     |Memory        |
|:--------------:| ----------------- |--------   |--------------|
| Dictionary     | Easy              |fastest    |less efficient|
| List of Lists  | Easy              |slowest    |inefficient   |
| List of Tuples | Harder; immutable |dict faster|efficient     |
| List of Counts |                   |           |              |

## Probability

Application: making judgements based on uncertain information
ex:
- Diagnosis: predict symptoms
- Risk Assessment: financial and environmental
- Product Reliability: electronics and vehicles

##### Dylan:
Digital Twin
- New Digital Modeling Technology
- runs simulations to make predictions on possible breakage and wear

### Rules of Probability

Axiom - ~~a universal truth~~ -> a truth that is assumed

A and B are events of uncertain occurance

    0 < P(A) < 1
    P(True) = 1
    P(False) = 0
    P(A  or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
    P(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A  or B)

### Discrete Probability

Discrete Math vs Continuous Math

Deals with events that occur in countable sample spaces
ex:
- Coins
- Dice
- Cards

### Uniform Distribution

A known finite number of outcomes are equally likely to occur

Each of n values has probability is 1/n
ex:
- Rolling a fair Dice

```python

def sample(words):
    index = random.randint(0, len(words)-1)
    return words[index]

colors = [red, blue, green]
print(sample(colors))

```

### Tokens vs Types

Tokens
- occurrences of words

Types
- distinct words
