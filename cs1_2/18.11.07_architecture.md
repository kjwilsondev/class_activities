# Application Archietecture

### Questions

- What are the key features of the application? Are these clearly separated into their own files, classes, and/or modules?

    The key features of the application are the modules we pre-made (histogram, frequency, sampling). They separated into files named after their function for modularity.

    - Input text files
    - split text into words
    - count occurrences of each word
    - randomly generate word based on weight
    - output a string separated by spaces

- Are the names of files, modules, functions, and variables appropriate and accurate? Would a new programmer be able to understand the names without too much contextual knowledge?

    Features are named after their functionality

- What are the scopes of variables and are they appropriate for their use case? If there are global variables, why are they needed

    Variables are tailored to their respective functions for continuity.
    To prevent buggy code and side effects, global variables (gv) have been omitted.
    However, the flask api necessitates a gv.

- Are the functions small and clearly specified, with as few side effects as possible?

    Will do.

- Are there functions that could be better organized in an Object-Oriented Programming style by defining them as methods of a class?

    Functions could be better organized in OOP
    because they passing through the same argument.

- Can files be used as both modules and as scripts?

    Will do
    'Dictogram' is an example of this

- Do modules all depend on each other or can they be used independently?

    Will do.

**Init**

```python

    def __init__(self, word_list=None):
    		"""Initialize this histogram as a new dict and count given words."""
    		super(Dictogram, self).__init__()  # Initialize this as a new dict
    		# Add properties to track useful word counts for this histogram
    		self.types = 0  # Count of distinct word types in this histogram
    		self.tokens = 0  # Total count of all word tokens in this histogram
    		# Count words in given list, if any

            # CHECKS IF WORD LIST HAS WORDS
    		if word_list is not None:
    			for word in word_list:
    				self.add_count(word)

```

**Add Count**

```python

    def add_count(self, word, count=1):
        """Increase frequency count of given word by given count amount."""
        # TODO: Increase word frequency by count
        self.tokens += count

        # IF THE WORD IS IN THE DICTIONARY
        if word in self:
            # INCREMENT THE COUNT BY 1
            self[word] += count
            # self[word] = count + self[word]

        # IF THE WORD IS NOT IN THE DICT
        else:
            # INCREMENT THE TYPE BY 1
            self.types += 1
            self[word] = count

```
**Frequency**

```python

    def frequency(self, word):
        """Return frequency count of given word, or 0 if word is not found."""
        # TODO: Retrieve word frequency count
        if word in self:
            return self[word]
        else:
            return 0

```

#### Jasmine:

What is super?

```python

    def __init__(self, word_list=None):
        """Initialize this histogram as a new dict and count given words."""
        super(Dictogram, self).__init__()  # Initialize this as a new dict

```

super()
- retrieves what is the super class of class
- in this case => super class of Dictogram is type dict
- super(Dictogram, self) and dict are interchangeable

### How OOP Actually Works

Data and Functions

Input - Processing - Output

Programmer writes
- Classes
    - Data declaration
    - Fuctions

Computer creates
- object data
    - object attributes
    - class definitions
- global and class functions

Because of this, *'under the hood'*, similar code is stored the same way

Identical:

```python
    histogram.add_count('two', 2)
    Dictogram.add_count(histogram, 'two', 2)
```

Self (and this) are references to the class of objects.
In python, self is named self merely as a convention

### Markov Chains

**Fun Stuff:**

['one', 'fish', 'two', 'fish', 'red', 'fish', 'blue', 'fish', 'red', 'fish']

List of states:

What comes after 'fish' according the model above
- 'fish' -> 'two'
- 'fish' -> 'red'
- 'fish' -> 'blue'

Fishtogram:
- ('two', 1)
- ('red', 2)
- ('blue', 1)

You can have as many histograms as value types =>
**HENCE, IT IS OF YOUR BEST INTEREST TO MAKE A DICTIONARY OF HISTOGRAMS**
