# Linked Lists and Hash Tables

.head and .tail = attributes we can modify at anytime

When adding a new node
- Arrange the pointers of the new node
- THEN rearrange the pointers of the old node

### Niccolai

**Append**

```Python
        def append(self, item):
            """Insert the given item at the tail of this linked list."""
            # Create new node to hold given item
            # Append node after tail, if it exists

            new_node = Node(item)

            # First checks if head is empty
            # .head -> //
            # .tail -> //
            # if self.head is None:

            # is_empty() returns boolean: self.head is None
            if self.is_empty():
                self.head = new_node
                # Sets linked list has one item: the head is also tail
                self.tail = new_node
            # If linked list isn't empty
            else:
                assert.self.tail is not None
                # ^^^ this assertion will blow up code if tail is None
                # Sets tail pointer to new node
                self.tail.next = new_node
                # Sets new node as the new tail
                self.tail = new_node
```

**Length**

```Python
        def length(self):
            """Return the length of this linked list by traversing its nodes."""
            # Loop through all nodes and count one for each

            node_count = 0
            # counts nodes in item list from items method
            for item in self.items():
                item_count += 1
            return node_count
```

This method is over-extensive. Runs for a very long time and takes a lot of memory.

I used a custom *size* attribute and adds one every time a node is appended

**Prepend**

```Python
        def prepend(self, item):
            """Insert the given item at the head of this linked list."""
            # O(1) because we keep track of head
            # Create new node to hold given item
            # Prepend node before head, if it exists

            new_node = Node(item)
            new_node.next = self.head
            self.head = new_node
            # If linked list was empty
            if self.tail is None:
                # Sets tail as the node the function created
                self.tail = new_node
```

**Find**

```Python
def find(self, quality):
    """Return an item from this linked list satisfying the given quality."""
    # Loop through all nodes to find item where quality(item) is True
    # Check if node's data satisfies given quality function

    node = self.head
    while node is not None:
        if quality(node.data) is True:
            return node.data
        else:
            node = node.next
    # If item satisfying quality is never found
    return None
```

This is the only way to traverse through a linked list

# Hash Tables

map() and dict() are abstract objects that use keys
- Both are implemented by *Hash Tables*
- Used because of strong average case performance (fast, most of the time)

Keys
- keyword used to retrieve data

Bucket
- fast-access location (much like array index)

Hash Functions - Converts a variable size input ot a fixed size output
- Same Input - Same output
- Arbitrary
- Input can be anything

Ideal Hash (Output of Hash Functions)
- Huge output range between 0 and 2^32-1
- Repeatable and fast
- Output is unsigned
- Arbitrarily outputs space keys among output space
- Small differences input result in large differences in output

b = number of buckets

    bucket = hash(key) % b

**Collisions**
Stackable Bunk Chairs

It is impossible to map all possible input to a fixed output space
without some inputs generating the same output

Chaining
- Uses linked list to store multiple values
- Each bucket contains a linked list
- When values collide - node is added to end of list
- to retrieve data use find inside the linked list

Linear Probing
- Uses the next seat available
