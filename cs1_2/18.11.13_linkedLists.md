# Linked Lists

### Arrays

    An array is a contiguous piece of memory with same size storage space at each index

contiguous - next or together in sequence

Essentially, looks like a string of boxes right next to each other

Types:
- Static
    - Memory allocated once, size can't change
    - Tuples
- Dynamic
    - new memory allocated, array copied to grow
    - slow but convenient

Address
- The name of the box where data is held - index
- size = how many bites of data each box can hold
- address[index] = address[0] + (size * index)
- ex: A[0] = 2000
    - A[4] = 2016

Runtime
- if youre reading this I forgot everything Alan said
- I'm sorry :(

### Linked Lists

- Not contiguous piece of memory
- Differing size storage space at each index
- Dynamic
    - New piece of memory allocated
    - No need to copy the whole thing
- Can't access data without starting at the head first

**Nodes**

The first node is called *the head node*
Each node acts like a refrence:
- points to data
- and points to the next node in the structure

***Mutable Linked List** - head node acts as head for multiple linked list***

Homework -

    Make functions for class LinkedList

- length
- append(item)
- prepend(item)
- find(quality)
- delete(item)

**Linked List Activity**
Takeaway - When adding a new node to the middle of a linked list
- FIRST point the new node to the node that will be next in line
- THEN remove the old link between the nodes and point the node in front to the new node
